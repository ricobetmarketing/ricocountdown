## 🔎 THE CLUE LOGS

### 📍 CLUE #1: The Invisible Ink
Somewhere in this very file, a secret code is written in "Ghost Ink." Most eyes will skip right over it. Perhaps "Selecting All" (Ctrl+A) will reveal the truth?

  <b style="color:#fafbfc;">HIDDEN_VAULT</b> 
</p>
### 📍 CLUE #2: The System Configuration
Our lead engineer hid a voucher inside the system's core configuration. It is disguised as a boring technical parameter. 
* **Target File:** `config.json`
* **Status:** [OPEN FILE](./config.json)

### 📍 CLUE #3: The Time Traveler's Debt
One voucher was so powerful we had to "delete" it from the current version. But on GitHub, nothing is ever truly gone. You must look into the **Time Stream**.
* **Instruction:** Click on the **"Commits"** tab at the top of this folder. Look for a deleted line in the history.
* **Status:** [VIEW HISTORY](../../commits/main)

### 📍 CLUE #4: The Navigator's Console
The most interactive clues are hidden within our **Main Terminal Page**. It requires a sharp eye and a zoom lens.
* **Instruction:** Visit the live mission page. Look at the edges of the map.
